This was a hardware project implemented at University of Illinois hackathon where we used an Intel Edison chip to host a multi-user function racing game using a Django Server. The game running on the client side used an accelerometer to control the player movements and these accelerometer signals were sent as distinct signals to the javascript applet that controlled the user direction.
